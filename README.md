# Alberto_Houses_Regression
I carried out a Linear Regression model in order to predict the price of properties.

The objective is to predict what the house prices will be by implementing a Linear Regression Model.

After cleaning and exploring the dataset we can carry out our model taking into account the variables will help us predict the prices.
